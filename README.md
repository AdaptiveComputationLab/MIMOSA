# MIMOSA
MIMOSA is a system for selecting and deploying covering combinations of artifact mitigations to maximize analysis throughput and accuracy. Mimosa project consists of three modules integrated to create an end-to-end pipeline for feedback-driven, low-overhead, and large-scale evasive malware analysis. MIMOSA is a collaborative result of [The Adaptive Computation Lab at Arizona State University (ASU)](https://github.com/AdaptiveComputationLab/), [Electerical Engineering and Computer Science Department of University of Michigan Ann Arbor (UMich)](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/), and [the Computer Security Lab at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/).
