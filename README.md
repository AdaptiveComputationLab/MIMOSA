# MIMOSA
MIMOSA is a system for selecting and deploying covering combinations of artifact mitigations to maximize analysis throughput and accuracy. Mimosa project consists of four modules integrated to create an end-to-end pipeline for feedback-driven, low-overhead, and large-scale evasive malware analysis. MIMOSA is a collaborative result of [The Adaptive Computation Lab at Arizona State University (ASU)](https://github.com/AdaptiveComputationLab/), [Electerical Engineering and Computer Science Department of University of Michigan Ann Arbor (UMich)](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/), and [the Computer Security Lab at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/). 

# Workflow
In the following, we briefly describe each sub-project and our contribution in each of those:

* [cuckoo](./cuckoo): 
* [VMCloak](./vmcloak/README.md): 
* [detox](./detox/README.md):
* [dispatcher](./dispatcher/README.md):
